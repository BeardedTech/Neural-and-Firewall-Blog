# Neural-and-Firewall-Blog

I'm an ITSM Manager and digital forensics analyst from Sri Lanka, but based in Muscat, Oman. I'm currently exploring the cybersecurity space and figuring out where I fit in. I’m also into automation and AI, often building small tools to make life easier. Coding is my creative outlet, so what I share here isn’t polished — just practical stuff that works for me. This blog is where I document my learning and give back to the community. If you're into tech experiments and solving real-world problems, you're in the right place.
